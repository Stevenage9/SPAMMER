# SPAMMER
## Spammer tailored for discord.

It's time.

Ladies, Gentlemen, and everyone in between, I present to you, the ***SPAMMER.***

It isn't any ordinary spam application. It is a **special** one.

What makes it so special? Well, for starters, It is fully automated and free of charge, and tailored in such a manner that it is *perfect* for discord exp grinding. All aspects are customizable, and the application is truly afk-able, meaning that you can set it up, turn it on, and leave your system on overnight to see a TREMENDOUS boost in server experience points.

Worried about storage, un-installation? We've got you covered. It is available in two flavors: **Minimal portable**, and **Zipped portable**. Minimal portable is one single exe file, which has all required components of this tool packaged neatly inside of it. Zipped portable is a zip folder with an exe file executing the parts, which are outside of it. Choose your flavor.

And yes, it is, in fact, a completely open-source project, meaning that any average Joe could pick up python and contribute to this creation.

### How to use:
#### *For Minimal Portable:*
- Download the .exe file from [releases](https://github.com/Stevenage9/SPAMMER/releases/) and double click it to run
- Follow instructions/answer what the app requests and you'll be good to go.

#### *For Zipped Portable:* 

 - Download `Zipped_Portable.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/Stevenage9/SPAMMER/releases/) and right click to open in folder/show in folder
 - Right click the zip archive that shows up in the file explorer menu and click extract here
 - A folder named `Zipped_Portable` should be created
 - Open this folder
 - Double click (run) the shortcut named `SPAMMER` for the application to start
 - Follow instructions/answer what the app requests and you'll be good to go.
